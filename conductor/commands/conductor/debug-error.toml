Please help diagnose and fix the following error:

{{args}}

## Diagnostic Process

### 1. Error Analysis

#### Understand the Error
- What is the error message?
- What type of error is it? (Syntax, Runtime, Logic, Type, Reference, etc.)
- When does it occur? (Compile-time, Runtime, specific conditions)
- What is the stack trace showing?

#### Identify the Source
- Which file and line number?
- Which function/method is failing?
- What was the execution path leading to the error?

### 2. Context Investigation

#### Code Context

Analyze the code around the error:
- What is this code trying to do?
- What are the inputs at the time of error?
- What are the variable states?
- Are there any assumptions being made?


#### Environment Context
- What environment? (Development, Staging, Production)
- Browser/Node version?
- Operating system?
- Dependencies and versions?

#### User Context
- What action triggered the error?
- Can it be reproduced consistently?
- Does it happen for all users or specific ones?
- What are the reproduction steps?

### 3. Root Cause Analysis

#### Common Error Patterns

**Null/Undefined Errors**

**Type Errors**

**Async Errors**

**Scope Errors**

**Off-by-One Errors**

### 4. Common Error Types & Solutions

**ReferenceError**
- Variable not declared
- Accessing before declaration
- Typo in variable name

**TypeError**
- Calling undefined as function
- Accessing property of null/undefined
- Wrong type passed to function

**SyntaxError**
- Missing brackets/parentheses
- Invalid syntax
- Import/export issues

**RangeError**
- Invalid array length
- Number out of range
- Stack overflow (recursion)

#### Network/API Errors

**404 Not Found**
- Wrong endpoint URL
- Resource doesn't exist
- Routing issue

**CORS Error**
- Cross-origin request blocked
- Missing CORS headers
- Incorrect origin configuration

**Timeout**
- Request taking too long
- Network issues
- Server not responding

**401/403 Errors**
- Authentication failed
- Missing token
- Insufficient permissions

### 5. Debugging Steps

#### Step 1: Reproduce the Error

1. Identify exact steps to trigger error
2. Note any specific conditions
3. Try in different environments


#### Step 2: Isolate the Problem

1. Add console.logs/debugger statements
2. Check variable values before error
3. Verify function inputs
4. Test in isolation


#### Step 3: Form Hypothesis

1. What do you think is causing it?
2. Why does it fail under these conditions?
3. What would fix it?


#### Step 4: Test the Fix

1. Apply potential fix
2. Verify error is resolved
3. Check for side effects
4. Test edge cases


#### Step 5: Prevent Recurrence

1. Add error handling
2. Add input validation
3. Add tests for this scenario
4. Add logging/monitoring


### 6. Debug Code Examples

#### Add Defensive Checks

#### Add Logging

### 7. Output Format
